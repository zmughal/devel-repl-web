# Visualisation

* Use the OutputCache plugin to retrieve the old data.
* associate each line of the output with a "type"
    * this type can be visualised in different ways (see section Types)

# Types

* graph: graphviz, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6344318/pure-javascript-graphviz-equivalent, https://code.google.com/p/canviz/
* plot: http://www.flotcharts.org/, https://github.com/shutterstock/rickshaw, https://github.com/mbostock/d3
  * see <https://github.com/jberger/Graphics-Flot>
* volume: https://github.com/xtk/X
* 2D image: use browswer for small images, use tiles for larger images
* geo: http://leafletjs.com/
* and for fun: list of media URLs <http://www.longtailvideo.com/jw-player/about/>

# Completion

* jq-console: emit events on tab and then do a call with the current text to the left
* activate completion within Devel::REPL
* return the list to the browser
* list options in drop-down
